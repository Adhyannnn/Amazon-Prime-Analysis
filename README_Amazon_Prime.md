# Amazon Prime Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing an Amazon Prime Movies & TV Shows dataset using Python (Pandas), MS Excel, MySQL, and Power BI.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the original and cleaned datasets.  
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook used for data cleaning and preprocessing.  
- `sql/`: SQL script used for schema creation and analysis queries.  
- `dashboard/`: Power BI dashboard providing visual insights.  

## üîß Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Jupyter Notebook)  
- MS Excel  
- MySQL  
- Power BI  

## üìä Steps Followed

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Cleaned dataset using Pandas in Jupyter Notebook.  
   - Removed nulls, handled missing values, and corrected data types.  
   - Exported cleaned dataset as `Cleaned Amazon Data.csv`.  
   - Applied additional formatting in MS Excel for better readability.  

2. **SQL Analysis**
   - Created MySQL schema and table for Amazon Prime dataset.  
   - Imported cleaned data into MySQL.  
   - Executed SQL queries to analyze content type distribution, country-based trends, release year patterns, and genre insights.  

3. **Power BI Visualization**
   - Designed an interactive dashboard showing:  
     - Movie vs TV Show counts  
     - Country-wise content distribution  
     - Genre/category trends  
     - Year-wise release analysis  
     - Ratings and duration patterns  

## üß† SQL Usage

1. Open MySQL Workbench or any SQL editor.  
2. Run the script `sql/Amazon_Analysis.sql` to create the schema and execute analysis queries.  
3. Import `Cleaned Amazon Data.csv` into the `amazon_data` table (via MySQL import or `LOAD DATA INFILE`).  

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Clone the repo.  
2. Open `notebooks/Cleaning.ipynb` to view the data cleaning process.  
3. Open `sql/Amazon_Analysis.sql` to explore the database schema and queries.  
4. Open `dashboard/Amazon_Analysis.pbix` in Power BI to explore the interactive visuals.
